# Music-Recommendation-System-using-Spotify-API


To build a Music Recommendation System using the Spotify API, we are required to collect real-time music data from Spotify. For this task, we need a Spotify developer account to get our credentials from Spotify to access their data.

Below is the process you can follow to sign up for the Spotify developer account and get your credentials.

Step 1: Create a Spotify Account
For a Spotify developer account, you need an account at Spotify. If you don’t use Spotify, create an account. You don’t need to purchase any subscription to get your credentials. Once you have created an account at Spotify (or you already have one) log in to your account from your web browser.

Step 2: Go to Your Spotify Developer Dashboard
Once you have created an account at Spotify, you need to log in to your Spotify developer dashboard. As you will be using this developer account for the first time, sign the agreement and verify your email. After these steps, we can move to the next step.

Step 3: Create An App
Once you have verified an email, you will see an option to create an app in your dashboard.

Click “Create app” and move to the next step.

Step 4: App Description
Fill in the app description

Step 5: Copy Your Client ID and Client Secret
After filling in the app description, you will be redirected to your id and password. If you click “View client secret”, you will see your password. Copy your credentials so that you can use them while building a Music Recommendation System using Python


I hope you have understood what a Music Recommendation System is. Now, building a Music Recommendation System using Spotify API and Python.
